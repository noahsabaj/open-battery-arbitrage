OpenBattery is an open source system that enables businesses to profit from electricity price differences throughout the day using battery storage. By charging when electricity is cheap and discharging when it's expensive, the system helps reduce energy costs while contributing to grid stability.

## Why OpenBattery Exists

Commercial electricity rates vary dramatically throughout the day, sometimes differing by 2-3Ã— between off-peak and peak periods. Traditional energy management systems are often expensive, proprietary black boxes with complex fee structures.

We're building OpenBattery because:

- Energy arbitrage technology should be accessible to all businesses
- Users deserve to understand and control their own systems
- Together we can build better solutions than any single company

## How It Works

OpenBattery consists of three primary components:

1. **Hardware Controller**: An open design for battery management and grid interface
2. **Arbitrage Algorithm**: Smart software that decides when to charge/discharge
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Simple interface showing system status and savings

The system monitors time-based electricity rates, weather forecasts, and usage patterns to automatically optimize battery operation without requiring user intervention.

## Project Status

OpenBattery is in early development. We're currently:

- Designing the system architecture
- Building the initial prototype
- Documenting core algorithms
- Seeking early collaborators and testers

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions in all forms:

- **Developers**: Help build firmware, algorithms, or interfaces
- **Engineers**: Contribute to hardware design and testing
- **Energy Experts**: Share knowledge about rate structures and grid requirements
- **Businesses**: Become early testers and provide real-world feedback

See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details on how to participate.

## Business Model

OpenBattery follows a transparent "two-fee" model:

1. **Hardware Cost**: One-time purchase of the physical system
2. **Optional Service**: Simple annual maintenance fee with no hidden costs

We believe in the right to repair - customers can modify their systems as needed.
