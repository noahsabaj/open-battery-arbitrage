# How Energy Arbitrage Reduces Power Plant Emissions

## The Power Grid's Challenge

The electrical grid must match supply and demand in real-time. This creates three tiers of power plants:

### 1. Baseload Plants (Nuclear, Coal, Large Hydro)
- Run continuously at steady output
- More efficient and often less polluting per MWh
- Cannot quickly adjust output

### 2. Intermediate Plants (Combined Cycle Natural Gas)
- Can adjust somewhat to follow demand
- Medium efficiency and emissions

### 3. Peaker Plants (Simple Cycle Natural Gas, Oil, Diesel)
- Only run during highest demand (hot afternoons, cold evenings)
- 20-40% less efficient than baseload plants
- Significantly higher emissions per MWh
- Very expensive to operate

## How Battery Arbitrage Reduces Emissions

When thousands of batteries follow a smart charging pattern:

### During Off-Peak Hours (Night/Morning):
- They charge using primarily baseload power
- These plants are already running (even if demand is low)
- Often this captures excess wind energy that peaks at night
- The additional power plants running during off-peak hours are typically more modern and efficient than the emergency peaker plants used during high demand. (The marginal generation is relatively efficient, in energy industry jargon)

### During Peak Hours (Afternoon/Evening):
- Without batteries: Grid operators must fire up dirty, inefficient peaker plants
- With batteries: Stored energy is released, reducing the need for peaker plants
- Fewer peaker plants run, or they run for shorter periods (good, because peaker plants make dirtier electricity)

## The Emissions Math

The CO₂ savings come from this efficiency difference:

- Peaker plants: ~1,100 lbs CO₂/MWh (inefficient combustion)
- Baseload mix: ~600-800 lbs CO₂/MWh (more efficient generation)

Every MWh shifted from peak to off-peak avoids ~300-500 lbs of CO₂ emissions.

## Additional Benefits

- **Smoother Operation**: Fewer start-stop cycles of power plants (which create extra emissions, starting an engine and stopping it wastes electricity in the ramp-up and ramp-down when fuel is being used but electricity is not being produced)
- **Renewable Integration**: Batteries can store solar/wind energy that might otherwise be curtailed (if wind turbines are making more electricity than is being used, there is substantial waste as the electricity is not being used, it disappears. Storing it in a battery allows it to be used as needed)
- **Grid Efficiency**: Reduced transmission congestion during peak periods (electricity distribution is now a more distributed system as users can dispense from their neighborhoods or business locations, reducing wear on the primary electricity transmission lines)

This "peak shaving" effect is why grid operators and utilities are increasingly investing in large-scale batteries themselves - they recognize both the economic and environmental benefits of distributed energy storage systems like OpenBattery.
