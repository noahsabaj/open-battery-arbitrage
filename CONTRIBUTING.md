2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Create a branch** for your changes
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Submit a pull request**

Even if you're not ready to contribute code yet, joining the conversation is extremely valuable. Share your experiences with energy pricing, battery systems, or grid connections.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Code Contributions

- **Firmware Development**: Battery management, grid interface, safety systems
- **Arbitrage Algorithms**: Price prediction, charge/discharge optimization
- **User Interfaces**: Monitoring dashboards, setup wizards
- **Testing Tools**: Simulation frameworks, testing utilities

### Hardware Contributions

- **Circuit Designs**: Power electronics, safety systems, sensors
- **Enclosure Designs**: Physical layouts, cooling solutions, installation guides
- **Component Selection**: BOM optimization, alternative parts

### Documentation

### Branch Naming

- `feature/short-description` for new features
- `fix/issue-description` for bug fixes
- `docs/what-changed` for documentation
- `hardware/component-name` for hardware changes

## Submission Guidelines

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or relevant documentation with details of changes
2. Include relevant issue numbers in your PR description
3. PRs should address a single concern (feature, bug fix, etc.)
4. For hardware changes, include schematics and BOMs where applicable
5. Wait for review from maintainers

### Commit Messages

Good commit messages help reviewers understand your changes:

```
